# Hiral-Parmar-Capstone
Developed an automated timetable generator that creates weekly schedules from Excel input, considering instructor availability, course credits, and lab sessions. The algorithm minimizes clashes, ensures continuous sessions for instructors, and respects priority slots for specific faculty.
